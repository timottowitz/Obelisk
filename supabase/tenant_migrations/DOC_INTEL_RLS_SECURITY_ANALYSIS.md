# Doc Intel RLS Security Implementation - BE-001

## Summary
This document outlines the enhanced Row Level Security (RLS) implementation for Doc Intel tables, addressing P0 security vulnerabilities in multi-tenant data isolation.

## Critical Security Issues Addressed

### 1. **Weak Authentication Patterns** ❌ → ✅
**Before**: Policies only checked `auth.uid()` without organization context
```sql
-- OLD: Vulnerable policy
CREATE POLICY documents_user_access ON documents
    FOR ALL
    USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

**After**: Enhanced organization-aware authentication
```sql
-- NEW: Secure policy with organization verification
CREATE POLICY documents_select_policy ON documents
    FOR SELECT
    TO authenticated
    USING (
        user_belongs_to_current_organization(auth.uid()) AND
        user_belongs_to_current_organization(user_id)
    );
```

### 2. **Missing Cross-Tenant Isolation** ❌ → ✅
**Before**: No verification that users access only their organization's data
**After**: All policies now verify both:
- User belongs to current organization
- Target data belongs to same organization

### 3. **Insufficient CRUD Granularity** ❌ → ✅
**Before**: Single "ALL" policies for all operations
**After**: Separate policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE with appropriate checks

## Enhanced RLS Implementation

### Tables Secured
✅ `documents` - Document intelligence files
✅ `entities` - Extracted entities from documents  
✅ `doc_intel_job_queue` - Processing jobs (renamed from doc_intel_jobs)
✅ `doc_intel_job_logs` - Job execution logs
✅ `doc_intel_job_heartbeats` - Job monitoring heartbeats

### Security Helper Functions

#### `get_current_organization_id()`
- Extracts organization ID from current tenant schema name
- Used to identify the organization context for RLS checks
- Security: `SECURITY DEFINER STABLE` for safe execution

#### `user_belongs_to_current_organization(user_uuid)`
- Verifies user is an active member of the current organization
- Prevents cross-tenant data access
- Returns `BOOLEAN` for policy evaluation

### RLS Policy Pattern

Each table now implements 4 granular policies:

1. **SELECT Policy**: Users can only view data from their organization
2. **INSERT Policy**: Users can only create data in their organization  
3. **UPDATE Policy**: Users can only modify their own data in their organization
4. **DELETE Policy**: Users can only delete their own data in their organization

### Multi-Layer Security Verification

Each policy enforces multiple security checks:

1. **User Authentication**: `user_belongs_to_current_organization(auth.uid())`
2. **Data Owner Verification**: `user_belongs_to_current_organization(user_id)`  
3. **Ownership Check**: `user_id = auth.uid()` (where applicable)
4. **Relationship Integrity**: EXISTS queries for related data (entities, logs, heartbeats)

## Cross-Tenant Access Prevention

### Schema-Level Isolation
- Each organization has dedicated schema (`org_<uuid>`)
- Schema names mapped to organization IDs in `private.organizations`
- Helper functions extract org context from current schema

### Policy-Level Protection
```sql
-- Example: Entities policy prevents access to documents from other orgs
EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM documents d
    WHERE d.id = entities.document_id 
    AND user_belongs_to_current_organization(d.user_id)
    AND d.user_id = auth.uid()
)
```

### Cascading Security
- Job logs/heartbeats inherit security from job queue
- Entities inherit security from documents  
- All relationships verified through EXISTS subqueries

## Testing & Verification

### Included Test Queries
The migration includes SQL queries for verification:

1. **User Data Access**: Verify users see only their documents
2. **Cross-Tenant Denial**: Confirm users cannot access other organizations
3. **Entity Scoping**: Validate entity access is properly scoped
4. **Job Queue Security**: Test job processing security
5. **Relationship Integrity**: Ensure cascading security works

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Setup Test Organizations**: Create 2+ test organizations
2. **Create Test Users**: Add users to different organizations  
3. **Insert Test Data**: Add documents/jobs in each organization
4. **Verify Isolation**: Confirm users cannot access cross-organization data
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Verify behavior with inactive users, missing relationships

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Helper functions marked as `STABLE` for query planning optimization
- Policies use efficient EXISTS queries instead of JOINs where possible
- Indexes on foreign key relationships support policy execution

### Caching Strategy  
- Organization membership queries cacheable due to `STABLE` functions
- Schema-based organization lookup is deterministic per connection

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Existing tenant schemas with Doc Intel tables
- Valid data in `private.organizations` and `private.organization_members`

### Migration Steps
1. Run `20250830_120000_enhanced_doc_intel_rls.sql` on each tenant schema
2. Verify helper functions are created correctly
3. Test policies with sample data
4. Monitor query performance after deployment

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Disable RLS temporarily: `ALTER TABLE <table> DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
2. Restore original policies from backup
3. Re-enable RLS after fixes

## Security Compliance

### P0 Requirements ✅
- [x] RLS enabled on all Doc Intel tables
- [x] Policies scope by tenant_id and user's org membership
- [x] Cross-tenant access is denied  
- [x] Comprehensive RLS policies for all CRUD operations

### Additional Security Measures
- [x] Helper functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` for safe execution
- [x] All policies verify organization membership
- [x] Cascading security through relationship verification
- [x] Granular permissions for SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Security Audit Checklist
- [ ] Verify RLS is enabled on all tables
- [ ] Test cross-tenant access denial monthly
- [ ] Monitor policy query performance  
- [ ] Audit organization membership changes
- [ ] Review helper function security regularly

### Performance Monitoring
- Watch for slow queries due to policy overhead
- Monitor organization membership lookup performance
- Track EXISTS subquery execution times
